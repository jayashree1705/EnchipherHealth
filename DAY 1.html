<h1>Why I go for HTML</h1>
    <p>Every website you see Google, Amazon, YouTube starts with HTML.It provides the structure of a webpage.
Without HTML, web development cannot exist.</p>
<p> I chose HTML because it is the foundation of web development and an essential skill for any IT role. It helps me understand the structure of webpages, create user interfaces, and connect my backend to a usable frontend. HTML also builds my confidence as a beginner and opens the path to full-stack and advanced development.</p>
<p>Even as a tester, understanding the DOM structure is essential. It helps me inspect elements, write better locators, understand UI behavior, and detect defects accurately.  </p>
